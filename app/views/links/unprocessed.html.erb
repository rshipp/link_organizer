    When new links are added to this site, we try to automatically assign some tags based on the text contents.
    But this process is error-prone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Manually summarizing and adding correct tags to links makes it easier to find the one you're looking for in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    The links below have not yet been processed by a person, and may have incorrect tags and a missing summary.
    Please review the link content, edit its tags, and write a quick summary or any important details in the "Notes" field.
    When you've fully filled in the tags and notes, and edited any other fields that need changing, check the "Processed" box, and save the link details with the "Update Link" button.
